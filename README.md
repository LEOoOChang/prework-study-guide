## Description

The project is built to put students in a better position to get started with the bootcamp courses. The goal is to be successful throughout the learning journey. It solves the problem that learners with zero coding background tend to face more challenges when learning completely new knowledge and skills. As far as I am concerned, I have learned, most importantly, developers' mindset that there will be solutions to any problems. Do not give up!
